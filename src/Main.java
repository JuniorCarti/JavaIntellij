        // The difference between print() and println():
        // - print() prints text on the same line.
        // - println() prints text on a new line each time it's called.
        // - Adding "\n" creates a blank line between text.

        // Printing three lines of text
        System.out.println("My Best Car Model. Mercedes Benz G-Wagon\n"); // Prints on a new line
        System.out.println("It costs a lot of Dollars\n"); // Another line
        System.out.println("I'll buy it in 2026"); // Prints on a new line

    }
